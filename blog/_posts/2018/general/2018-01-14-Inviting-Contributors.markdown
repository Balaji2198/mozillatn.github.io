First of all, Wish you happy Pongal. During this amazing harvesting festival we contributors from Tamilnadu would like to welcome new contributors who would like to contribute to MozillaTN social media accounts and mentoring campus clubs. Below is the list of accounts you will have access.

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mozillaTN/)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MozillaTN/)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mozillatn/)

If you are interested please go ahead. 

Our social media maintainers have done really a great job, our facebook and twitter engagement are really great and all our websites and club websites are having good amount of page views. We have made some great things and done great initiatives like promoting Test Pilots experiments. 


### What skills do you need.

- Passion to contribute to community. Our Community members started to contribute to Mozilla to learn/earn skills. This is the only expectation they had, everything else followed them.
- Basic understanding of Social media works like how to post in Facebook pages, Twitter accounts.
- If you have experience with running mail campaings & design skills it will be great plus.

### What you will gain in return

- Live experience, our social media accounts have high reputation and also we respect our followers so we make sure everything shared is correct.


Secondly we are invitating contributors who can help other college contributors to maintain their website and help them to know the latest trends happening in the Mozilla community. This role is mainly focused on building communities in colleges. We have now more number of contributors who are focusing deeply technical contributions in areas like WebVR, WebExt,Rust and so on. At the same time we have less focus on exploring other areas available in Mozilla. 

In this role first we expect all the Students Club to maintain club websites like some of the colleges have.

- [SNSCT](https://mozillatn.github.io/snsct/)

- [SRMkzilla](https://mozillatn.github.io/srmkzilla/)

Second coordinate with other student contributors and encourage them to contribute in various ways.

Third make sure you foucs on anyone technical contribution areas, so you can build yourself and help you in long time. 

Exciting to see how 2018 is going to be for our MozillaTN community. There are lot of ways we are contribute and learn a lot.

Finally Wish you a happy new year 2018.

Proud to be a Mozillian!!
