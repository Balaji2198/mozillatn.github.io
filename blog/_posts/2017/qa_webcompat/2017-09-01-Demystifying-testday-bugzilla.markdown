Hello Readers!!

![Mozilla QA]({{ site.url }}/assets/qmo.jpeg)

Mozilla India has been doing a consistent QA contribution in the past year. As days go by, we felt that new contributors who are doing their first contribution are in need of help to understand the complete testing and the bug filling process. 

In order to help, our contributors [Surentharan .R.A](https://twitter.com/surentharan7) and [Fahima Zulfath A](https://twitter.com/FahimaZulfath) are going to conduct a live session in youtube on Sept 2nd 2017 , from 9:00 pm to 10:00 pm , explaining the complete steps in testday and filling a bug in bugzilla. 

The link for the youtube screencast will be shared in our Mozilla India telegram group. Join us [here](https://t.me/MozIndia_QA)

Thanks for reading !
Together, let us make firefox better!!
