### What is Software Freedom Day (SFD) ?

**Software Freedom Day (SFD)** is an annual worldwide celebration for Free software organized by Digital Freedom Foundation. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness on Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use. Usually Software Freedom Day is celebrated worldwide on third week of September.


### Community Space Chennai

After a lot of struggle our Mozilla community got a opportunity to do more offline events outside college. Thanks to Sayaji from KCG college of Technology who worked hard and talked with his college management to arrange this space. We also had offline events at that same space.
