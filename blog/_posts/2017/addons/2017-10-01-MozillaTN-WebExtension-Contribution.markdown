September is one of the good month we at MozillaTN had in terms of Contribution to Add-ons Community. With the support from Mozilla India community contributors and AMO team we have conducted 2 hackathons at different places and also created some of the educational tutorials for the benefit of young WebExtension Developers. Learn more in detail below.

On September 9th we had our first event of the Month at SNSCT, Coimbatore. It is one of the active Students club in Tamilnadu. Large number of QA contributors are from this college. They are most interested in learning the new technology and applying it practically. Our contributors Viswaprasath and Selva Makilan participated in this event. Around 30 students attended the event. The detailed event post is written here. [1](http://iamvp7.in/SNSCT-MozActivate-WebExt-workshop/) [2](https://selvamakilan.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/addons-campaign-snsct/)

Our Community is growing very well with respect to WebExtension development. And Firefox 57 is on the way, which means we have lot of place to be creative and bring more add-ons. Lets get started and enjoy developing more WebExtension to browsers.
